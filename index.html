                    At 8 years old, I joined a website called Neopets and made two life-long friends as well as a love
                    for
                    creating webpages.

                    <br><br>

                    Since then, I've been playing with making websites as a hobby.

                    <br><br>

                    Some websites I have worked on include Philippine Spirits, a site based on Philippine mythology and
                    folklore.
                    Another is ComicFighter, which a is a large database of more than 700 comics translated from
                    Japanese to English mainly about fighting games.

                I began coding through Neopets when I was 8 years old.
                There was a way to make webpages about your Neopet pet, and I would document lavish stories about my
                pets through these pages.

                <br><br>

                As I got older, I realized that more than illustrating, I liked making communicative objects that
                weren't limited to images.

                <br><br>

                <div class="grid-container-five" style="align-items:center;">
                    <img src="img/subikiamano.jpg">
                    <img src="img/blairesanzang.jpg">
                </div>

                <br><br>

                I learned how to book-bind, I learned how to sew outfits, and I even learned how to sculpt with felt to
                communicate different messages.

                <br><br>

                <div class="grid-container-five" style="align-items:center;">
                    <img src="img/athenaiorishirt.jpg">
                    <img src="img/aswangshirt.jpg">
                    <img src="img/relaxakumashirt.jpg">
                </div>

                <br><br>

                I made a business centered around fighting video game fan art called Saltamiya. With various skilled I
                picked up from hobbies such as cosplay and website development, I made my own website and sell homemade
                stickers, keychains, pillows, shirts, buttons, and prints.

                <br><br>

                <div class="grid-container-five" style="align-items:center;">
                    <img src="img/saltamiyapillows.jfif">
                    <img src="img/stickers.jfif">
                </div>

                <br><br>

                Eventually, I went back to my roots of using HTML and CSS to make webpages to supplement my business of
                selling my artwork and found that designing pages was something I enjoyed.

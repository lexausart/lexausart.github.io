                I began coding through Neopets when I was 8 years old.
                There was a way to make webpages about your Neopet pet, and I would document lavish stories about my
                pets through these pages.

                <br><br>

                As I got older, I realized that more than illustrating, I liked making communicative objects that
                weren't limited to images.

                <br><br>

                I learned how to book-bind, I learned how to sew outfits, and I even learned how to sculpt with felt to
                communicate different messages.

                <br><br>

                Eventually, I went back to my roots of using HTML and CSS to make webpages to supplement my business of
                selling my artwork and found that designing pages was something I enjoyed.
